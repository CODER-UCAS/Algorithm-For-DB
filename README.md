# Introduction
  This repository will contains kinds of basic algorithm in DB field! I hope this repo can help some person who love Data base, and welcome to contact me any time!
  
# Algorithm supported
  I am coding the following algorithms, they will be realized by C++!
  The following algorithms will be realized within a short time period!
